This is the project which has been done by taking the references of many other projects and I have changed some of the parameters 
and changed some hidden layers to achive a good accuracy in a faster way , In this project I have achived an accuracy of 94-95%. 
Due to a large data set it took nearly 3 hours to train the model and nearly took 1 day to change the parameters and check their accuracy.

For this project I have used the data set from kaggle , which should be downloaded before building the model into your pc.

To download the dataset please go through the below link -

For practice if you need a low dataset then go through the below link -
